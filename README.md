----

(i) codon-level embedding concatenation,
(ii) entropy-regularized attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning
(iii) crossmodal multi-head attention—

Methods
the Nucleotide Transformer (Dalla-Torre et al., 2023) for DNA (6-mer tokenization),
RNA-FM (Chen et al., 2022) for RNA (single nucleotide tokenization),
ESM-2 (Lin et al., 2022a) for protein (amino acid tokenization, i.e., 3-mers in nucleotide).


1. update the presentation with new results and LoRa Method
2. Plan for Demo
2. Implemnt Lora --> Alireza
3. Attention Plots and weights Analysis --> Serhat
3. get all the results for the 3 fusion methods
4. in Report update the related work part and Abstract
5. add the table and comparison with Biolang
6. Merge the classification.
